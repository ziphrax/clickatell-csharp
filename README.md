About:            
This package allows one to build a Clickatell SMS library that can be linked to your C# application. Said library provides public functions which make calls to Clickatell's HTTP and REST APIs, allowing one to send SMSes, query their user credit balance, query an SMS status, query the cost of an SMS,check SMS route coverage and stop an SMS.

The package also contains a simple C# ASP.NET test application that when compiled, links with the Clickatell SMS library. This test application indicates how to test SMS functionality of the Clickatell SMS library.

All three projects contains extensive code commenting
